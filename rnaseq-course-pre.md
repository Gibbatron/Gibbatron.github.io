## Install R, RStudio, and packages
- We will need to use Rstudio at the end of the course to run the shiny application.
- Firstly, we need to install R, then we can install RStudio, and then the packages.

**Install R**
- Go to this [link](https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/) and download the app.
- After installing, open R to initialise everything.
