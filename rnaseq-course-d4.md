## Outputs from the differentialabundance pipeline
---
---

- We should all have had an email from *SCW HAWK - HPC SERVICES* notifying you of a successful pipeline run.
- Sometimes the email function doesn't work. We can just log in and check ourselves.
- To check, we need to log back onto HAWK, load the tmux module, and then open the session that we created.

**Log on to HAWK**
- In VSCode, click on the 'Remote Explorer' button, then click 'Connect to Host in New Window' button. This opens a new VSCode window with the remote host.
- You will be prompted (top box) to enter your password. Do this and hit enter.
- You are now connected to HAWK.

<img src="/assets/img/pre-3.png" alt="Connecting to HAWK" width="1000"/>

- Click on 'Explorer' and then 'Open Folder'.
- A drop-down box appears at the top of the screen with a filepath. We need to change this to `/scratch/c.c1234567/rnaseq-course` and then click 'OK'.
- You may be prompted 'Do you trust the authors this folder?'. Click 'Trust all authors' or 'Yes'.
- You will now see that the directory will be open on the left of the window.

<img src="/assets/img/d1-fig2.png" alt="Opening a terminal window in VSCode" width="1000"/>

- Click on 'Terminal' at the top of your screen and select 'New Terminal'.
- In the terminal window at the bottom of your screen, paste the following:

```
#load tmux
module load tmux

#open our tmux session
tmux attach -t diff-abundance
```

- Upon opening the session, we should have a window that looks like this:

<img src="/assets/img/figure-19.png" alt="tmux completed run" width="1000"/>

***Linux Users***
```
#log onto HAWK
c.c1234567@hawklogin01.cf.ac.uk
PASSWORD

#move to the working directory (scratch)
cd /scratch/c.c1234567/rnaseq

#load tmux
module load tmux

#open our tmux session
tmux attach -t diff-abundance
```

- In this situation, the process took around 8 minutes. As all of us were using the pipeline at the same time, these times will likely vary. Download times will also depend on the size and number of files being downloaded.
- You will also notice the following message: "Merged table created with annotations >> saved to 'merged_table.tsv'.
- At the end of the differential abundance script, we tell HAWK to run another script that I have created that merges the output tables. This will make our lives easier when it comes to playing around with the differentially expressed genes.

---
#### Report directory
---
---

- This is where the main reporting output of the workflow is stored.
- Here we can find the report webpage (.html) and a zip file containing an R markdown file with all of the parameters to customise the reporting.

---
#### Plots directory
---
---

- Here we can find all of the stand-alone plots generated by the pipeline.
- Most of these plots are included in the webpage report.
- Plots include:
    - QC: quality control plots from initial processing.
    - Exploratory: boxplots, PCA plots, correlation and dendograms. These are all plots that can be used to abundance distributions, sample clustering/correlations and observe any outliers.
    - Differential: volcano plots showing DEGs.

---
#### Tables directory
---
---

- This is where we can find the tables containing the count data:
    - Annotation: annotation matrix.
    - Processed Abundance: processed abundance values from initial processing. i.e. normalised counts from DESeq2.
    - Differential: Results of diferential analysis. filtered and unfiltered tables for expression.
- We will also find 'merged_tables.tsv', the table that we generated at the end of the pipeline. This takes all of the tables and combines them into one.
---
#### Pipeline Information directory
---
---

- This directory contains all the files relevant to the pipeline that was run, such as a nextflow report, pipeline report.
- These files can be used to make a report if needed (handy when writing methods section).
- We donâ€™t need any of these files for the next stages.

---
#### ShinyNGS App directory
---
---

- This is where you will find the relevant files to run the Shiny app in R.
- We will cover how to run this below.

<br>

---
# So we've processed the samples and run the analysis pipeline... Now what?
---
---

- Now we can start exploring the data and begin answering our hypotheses.
- There are multiple things that we can do and multiple places we can start.
- I would highly reccommend that we start with the webpage report to have a general overview of the outputs.
- From there, we can then look at the Shiny app and use the built-in tools and filters to start exploring the data.
- We can then run additional analyses, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), and further enrichment analysis tool on various web-tools.

---
## Webpage Report
---
---

- Lets start with the webpage report.
- Navigate to `output/report/study.html` using 'Explorer'.
- Right click on the file and select 'Open Preview'. This will load the webpage in a preview window on your VSCode.

- The report contains all of the information about the differentialabundance analysis performed.
- At the top, we can see information about the Dataset, such as the sample name, strandedness and the condition columns that we added. Note that here I have a second condition column to bin the samples into cancer and control.
- Below this, we also have the contrasts table, indicating what contrasts we made. Note again here that I used the conditionTwo column to compare the Cancer samples to the Control samples.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-20.png" alt="Samples and contrasts tables" width="1000"/>

---
#### Results section
---
---

- This is where all of the plots and data are presented.

---
##### Counts
---
---

- Tells us how many input genes we had, and how many we had after filtering for low abundance.

---
##### Exploratory analysis
---
---

- Shows us a range of plots that allow us to explore the data.

**Box plots**
- show us the distribution of abundance values across the samples.
- Here we can see that we have 3 plots, one for each data type. We can see that normalisation and variance stabilisation has done a good gob. The purpose of this process is to adjust for differences in sequencing depth, control for different library sizes, minimize technical variability, and stabilise the variance across read counts.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-21.png" alt="boxplots" width="1000"/>

**Density plots**
- Give us an idea of overall expression levels across the dataset. Again, this section shows us the density plots across the 3 different data types.
- From the top 2 plots, it would be difficult to determine what is considered 'normal' expression here, as we have a lot of expression across the board. The point of normalisation and variance stabilisation is to make this easier to determine what is considered 'normal' expression and what is considered over expressed.
- We can see that in the variance stabilised plot, most of our genes are lowly/normally expressed (as indicated by the high peak on the left) and then we have a lwoer number of genes that would be considered over expressed.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-22.png" alt="density plots" width="1000"/>

**sample relationships**
- Here we will find PCA plots, Scree plots, association plots, dendrograms, and outlier detection plots.

**PCA**
- Plots show us how the samples cluster together. We can use this to see how similar or different samples are to eachother.
- The analysis is performed by using the top 500 most variable genes.
- We can see here that the Cancer samples (786-0) tightly cluster together on both PC1 and PC2 axes, whereas the Control samples (HK-2) are not so tightly clustered.
- However, there is a clear distinction between the two groups which is important when we are performing out differential analyses. We should see that there will be a higher number of differentially expressed genes in this analysis as theres a better separation between the groups.
- If we were to compare groups that didn't have a distinct separation, we would expect to see a lot less DEGs. We can also use this as an indicator of experimental conditions or techniques.
  - If one sample in condition A is clustering with the samples in conditon B, was there a chance that somebody mislabelled the sample?
  - If you drugged the same cell line for 1 hour and then compared drugged vs untreated, we would expect there to be very little difference between the groups and subsequently cluster close on a pca.
- When we look at the 3D PCA plot, where we are adding PC3 into the mix, we can see that there is more spread amongst the groups, but still a distinct separation between them.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-23.png" alt="PCA plots" width="1000"/>

**Scree plots**
- Show us the percent of variance that is explained by each principle component. We typically get most variance explained by PC1 and PC2, and then less and less explained by the latter PCs.
- We don't really need to pay any attention to this plot.


**Association plot**
- Shows the association between the principle components and the categorical covariates.
- I have not looked at this plot before, so can't comment much on it. I think this plot could potentially show more meaningful data if we had multiple conditions and we wanted to delve deeper into the PCA analyis.


**Dendrogram plots**
- Show us, similar to PCA, how the samples cluster in relation to eachother.
- Like the PCA plots, we can see that each group cluster togeher and are clearly separated from each other.
- These plots can be handy to identify any potential outliers, as you will see them cluster apart from their respective groups.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-24.png" alt="Dendrograms" width="1000"/>

**Outlier detection**
- Plot is a handy plot that performs an analysis that can attempt to detect outliers in the dataset.
- As we can see, all samples come up as FALSE, indicating that none are classed as outliers.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-25.png" alt="Outlier detection plot" width="1000"/>

---
##### Differential analysis
---
---

- This is where we can find the data related to the differential gene analysis.

**Differential gene counts**
- Table shows us the number of up and down DEGs for the adjusted and unadjusted p-value tables.
- When working with RNAseq data, we work with adjusted p values. Here, we can see that we have 3788 up and 4617 down significant DEGs.
- We can visualise these via the volcano plot below the table. We can use our mouse to hover over each point to show us what gene it is also.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-26.png" alt="DEG table and Volcano plot" width="1000"/>

- Below the volcano is the up and down DEG tables.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-27.png" alt="Up and Down DEG tables" width="1000"/>

- Then we have the methods section, where you will find all the filters and information about the pipeline.

---
## ShinyNGS App
---
---

- Now we can use the ShinyNGS app and start playing with the data.
- To use the app, we will be using arrca open OnDemand. This is a webpage where we can request the supercompute resources to run an R session, which saves us having to download R onto our PCs.
- Paste this link into your web browser and log in using your SCW account details: https://arcondemand.cardiff.ac.uk/
- Now click 'Interactive Apps' and select 'RStudio Server'

<img src="/assets/img/figure-32.png" alt="RStudio Server" width="1000"/>

- We will use default parameters for the server, so to launch, simply scroll to the bottom of the page and click 'Launch'.
- You will now be told that your server is in a queue and will be notified when it is active. This is usually instant, but depending on how many of us are asking to use it, could take some time to launch.
- Once it is ready to launch, you will see this window. Select 'Connect to RStudio Server'. This will open a new tab with the server

<img src="/assets/img/figure-33.png" alt="RStudio Server" width="1000"/>

- Now we have an RStudio server opened up which will allow us to run whatever we want without using our own computers resources. It also means that we can work directly with the files on our HAWK account without having to transfer them to our computers.
- We now want to open the shinyngs app directory and launch the app. To do this, we first need to navigate to it.
- Click on 'File > Open File...', this launches a popup window.
- Navigate to `rnaseq-course/output/shinyngs_app/MY-STUDY-NAME` and click on `app.R and then 'Open'.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-34.png" alt="Opening app.R" width="1000"/>

- This opens the script that is needed to launch the Shinyngs app.
- In an ideal world, we could launch this app by simply clicking on 'Run App' at the top right of this script. But in reality, the script needs certain packages to be installed and loaded before we can do this.
- We can install and load these packages by editing this script.
- To do this, click on the script and hit enter a few times to move the code lower down the page.
- We can now copy and paste the code below into the top of the script.
- **Note: Make sure you change the your username:**

```
install.packages('devtools')
install.packages('markdown')
install.packages('BiocManager')
library(BiocManager)
BiocManager::install("SummarizedExperiment")
BiocManager::install("GSEABase")
BiocManager::install("limma")
devtools::install_github('pinin4fjords/shinyngs')
library(devtools)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(GSEABase)
library(limma)
setwd(dir = "/scratch/c.c1234567/rnaseq-course/output/shinyngs_app/NAME-YOUR-PROJECT/")
```

<img src="/assets/img/figure-35.png" alt="Editing the script" width="1000"/>

- What we are doing here is telling R to install these pre-requisite packages. These packages are needed in order for the shinyngs package to install and work correctly.

- Now we can go ahead and run this script.
- The best way to do this is to click on the 'Run App' button at the top-right of the script.
- Alternatively, you can run each line by hitting `ctrl + enter` or `cmd + enter`.
- You will see that the bottom window will be populated with various text.
- Occaisionally, we will see the text ask us questions such as 'Update all/some/none?'
- We need to answer these questions before the script keeps running.
- Answer the questions by clicking in the bottom window, typing the answer and then hitting enter:

```
Update all/some/none? [a/s/n]
a
```

- a = update all
- s = update some
- n = update none

- To avoid complications, we want to **update all**

- If everything works, then you should get a pop-up window with the Shiny app.
- If this is not the case, please let me know so we can do some troubleshooting.

---
#### Home
---
---

- You will be greeted by the homepage. This page contains a small description of the app and how to navigate it.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-36.png" alt="shinyapp homepage" width="1000"/>

---
#### Sample data
---
---

- Clicking on this tab opens a dropdown menu with the following options:

**Experiment**
- Here you will find a fancy version of the diff-abundance-samplesheet.csv that was generated prior to the pipelines execution.
- You will see the sample IDs, fastq file paths, and condition information.

**Annotation**
- Here you will find a table of every gene in the dataset along with the corresponding information.

---
#### QC/exploratory
---
---

- Here you will find all the analyses related to QC and exploring the dataset. This is the same as what you will find in the report web page that we covered earlier.
- You may be thinking 'Why are we doing this if its already in the report web page?' - because the ShinyNGS app allows us to edit the parameters, filter, and look at specific genes etc!

**Distribution plots**
- Show's us the distribution of abundance values across the samples.
- You will see that there are parameters that we can change in the box on the left.
- You can use these parameters to change the look of the plots, colour by your conditions (if you had nore than one condition column).
- You can also change between the various data types  by using the matrix dropdown box.
- Finally, you can also export the plot(s) by clicking on the button in the 'Export' section.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-37.png" alt="distribution plots" width="1000"/>

**PCA**
- Plots show us how the samples cluster together. We can use this to see how similar or different samples are to eachother.
- There are 2 types of PCA plot to view here, one that displays the samples, the other displays the top genes. Use the tabs along the top of the plot to view this.
- Again, there are multiple parameters we can use to edit these plots, from number of PC loadings, to point size, to how many vairable genes to perform the analysis on.
- We can also switch between 2D and 3D plots.
- To save the plot(s), hover over the plot and click on the camera icon. This will save the photo directly to your computer.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-38.png" alt="pca plots" width="1000"/>

**I wont cover any more of the QC/Exploratory section as it is the same as the report webpage that I covered earlier. But I hope you get the idea that this app allows you to customise these plots for your needs**

---
#### Assay data
---
---

- The assay data section contains two sub-sections:

**Tables**
- Here you will find the data tables used for the analysis. The default view is the variance stabilised table. This contains the list of genes present in the dataset and the accompanying variance stabilised gene expression.
- Again, you can change the table by using the parameters on the left of the window.

**Heatmaps**
- This section displays a heatmap of the data (top 50 genes by variance).
- There are some nice options along the left, which allows us to additionally cluster the columns and select the number of top variant genes to perform the analysis on.
- The 'Scale by' section performs scaling of the gene expression along the chosen parameter. By default, we scale across the row. This takes the expression of each gene across all samples and scales it (usually from -1 to +1). This is to make it easier to see differences in expression of each gene across the samples.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-39.png" alt="heatmap" width="1000"/>

- Another nice function the app provides is the option to zoom in on certain genes/samples. To do this, use your mouse to click and drag over a specific region of the heatmap. You will see the heatmap zoom into your selection. To go back to default, simply click the heatmap.

<img src="/assets/img/d4-gif1.gif" alt="heatmap" width="1000"/>

---
#### Differential
---
---

- This is the section where we will find all the data related to the differential gene expression.

**Tables**
- This sub-section shows the tables containing the differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
- You will notice that the table also contains an expression value for each group, this is a 'combined' expression value for that particular group that was used as input for the differential expression testing.
- Along the side, we can filter this table for various parameters such as fold change expression (which is 2 by default), p value, and q value (adjusted p value).
- There is also a search box for you to search for your favourite genes.

**Fold change plots**
- This sub-section shows a scatter plot that compares the mean gene expression value between the two sample groups.
- Again, theres various filters you can add, and you can also hover over each point on the plot to identify the gene.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-40.png" alt="fold change plot" width="1000"/>

**MA plot**
- This sub-section shows an MA plot for the data.
- MA plots visualise the relationship between the magnitude of expression (mean expression) and the fold change across all genes.
- 'M' for difference: vertical axis. Shows difference in expression between the conditions (log2 fold change).
- 'A' for average: horizontal axis. Shows how much overall expression there is across both conditions (how 'active' or 'inactive' a gene is).
- The plot essentially tells us if genes with big changes (along the vertical axis) are generally highly expressed (towards the right on the horizontal axis) or lowly expressed (towards the left on the horizontal axis).
- A well centred/uniform plot here depicts good normalisation of the dataset.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-41.png" alt="MA plot" width="1000"/>

**Volcano plot**
- This sub-section shows a volcano plot of the DEGs.
- It shows us the degree of differential expression.
- Expression (log2 fold change) along the x-axis.
- Significance along the y-axis.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-42.png" alt="Volcano plot" width="1000"/>

---
#### Gene info
---
---

- The last section of the app allows us to gather more information about a specific gene.
- Using the 'Gene name' dropdown menu on the left, you can find your gene of interest and select it.
- This will populate the main window with a bar plot of the genes expression across your dataset.
- This is a better way to visualise the expression of a gene across your dataset instead of just pulling the data from the 'Assay data' section.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-43.png" alt="Gene info" width="1000"/>

---
## Downstream Analyses
---
---

- This is as far as we can go with the differential abundance pipeline. Some of you may see that there is an optional Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) plotting option on the pipe, but this is clunky at the moment.
- From here, we can take the DEGs do some extra analyses using free tools online. There is also a very good paid-for tool that the university has a licence for that I would reccommend.

---
### File Preparation
---
---

- Before we start doing some more downstream analyses, we need to get our gene list in the correct format(s).
- When we have a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we have some genes that are positively enriched (i.e. positive log2FC), and some that are negatively enriched (i.e. negative log2FC).
- This list of genes is often ordered by significance by the pipeline, rather than expression.
- What we first want to do to our DEG list is filter for significance to give us significant DEGs.
- Then we want to reorder our significant DEGs so that they go from positive-to-negative log2FC.
- This allows us to then run analyses on the ordered DEGs and also separate significantly positive and negative DEGs (if needed).

<br>

- We first need to download the `merged_table.tsv` from HAWK.
- To do this, right click on the file in VSCode and click 'Download'. Then specify where you want to save the file on your PC.
- Now we can open this file in Excel. To do this, right-click and click `Open With' then choose Excel.

<br>

-**Note:** We now need to use this table to make a few new tables which we will use as input for various tools. I would strongly reccomend firstly duplicating the table and editing the duplicated table.

**Significant DEGs**
- After duplicating the `merged_table.tsv`, rename it to whatever you want. I would reccommend being as descriptive as you can in your file naming.
- Example: `786-0_vs_HK-2_sigDEGs.tsv`
- Example: `786-0_vs_HK-2_sigDEGs_padj0.05.tsv`
- Now open the file in Excel.
- The table is currently showing us normalised, tsv, and DEG data.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-44.png" alt="DEG table" width="1000"/>

- We now need to delete columns. **Delete columns C-P**. This leaves us with the DEG only data.
- We can also then **delete the top row (row 1)** to get rid of the `data_type` information.
- Lastly, we can now **delete columns C, E, and F** to get rid of the `baseMean`, `lfcSE`, and `pvalue` columns.
- We should be left with 4 columns: `gene_id`, `gene_name`, `log2FoldChange`, and `padj`.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-45.png" alt="DEG table" width="1000"/>

- Now we can filter this table for significance. To do this, I would **strongly** reccomend the following:
- Click on column D to highlight it.
- Now click 'Sort & Filter' and select 'Sort Smallest to Largest'. Choose the 'Expand the selection' in the next popup window.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-46.png" alt="filtering DEG table" width="1000"/>

- We have now sorted the table by lowest to highest p adjusted value. We can now scroll through this table and delete the non-significant rows.
- The reason I reccomend doing it this way is that sometimes these tables can be thousands and thousands of rows long. Using the filter function sometimes doesn't work as it should and often slows down your PC whilst filtering.
- Scroll through the table to find padj < 0.05. For me, this is on row 13,158.
- Click on cell A13158, then scroll to the end of the table.
- Now hold `shift` and click on the last cell in column D to highlight the non-significant cells.
- Right click on the selected cells and click 'Delete...'. In the popup window, click 'Shift cells up'.
- We are now left with our significant DEGs. Save and then close the table.

**Significant UP and DOWN DEGs**
- Most of you will only be interested in analysing the significantly upregulated genes in your dataset.
- It is completely up to you how you go about this, but I always find it easier to have one file for each, i.e. all DEGs = 786-0_vs_HK-2_sigDEGs.tsv. UP DEGs = 786-0_vs_HK-2_sigDEGs_UP.tsv. DOWN DEGs = 786-0_vs_HK-2_sigDEGs_DOWN.tsv.
- However, I understand that most of you will want to keep things as simple as possible and not want to get bogged down by lost of files.
- I would strongly reccommend splitting your DEG file into UP and DOWN DEGs, either by creating additional files, or by creating a new sheet for each in the 786-0_vs_HK-2_sigDEGs.tsv file.

**Preranked DEGs for GSEA**
- For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, we will need to take these significant DEGs and rank them by log2 Fold Change.
- To do this, lets duplicate the significant DEG file and name it `preranked-DEGs-GSEA.tsv`.
- Open the table and **delete columns B and D** to remove the `gene_name` and `padj` columns.
- We are now left with 2 columns: `gene_id` and `log2FoldChange`.
- We now need to delete the top row of the table, i.e. delete the headers. We need to do this so that GSEA software can correctly read the file.
- Lastly, we need to order the `log2FoldChange` column (column B) from highest to lowest. To do this higlight the whole of column B by clicking on it, then click on 'Sort & Filter' and select 'Sort Largest to Smallest'. In the popup window, click 'Expand the selection'.

<img src="/assets/img/figure-47.png" alt="formatting GSEA file" width="1000"/>

- We have now preranked our DEGs. The last thing we now need to do is make sure we save it in the correct format, and rename it so that the software can recognise it.
- We first need to save the file. Click on 'File' then select 'Save As...'.
- Select the location to save the file, and then use the 'File Format:' dropdown bowx to select `Tab-delimited Text (.txt)`.
- You may have a popup window asking 'do you want to keep using this format?', select 'Yes'.
- We have now saved our file as a tab-delimited text (.txt) file (`preranked-DEGs-GSEA.txt`).

<details>
<summary><b>What is a tab-delimited text (.txt) file?</b></summary>

<br>

- A .txt file is simple text file that stores tabular data such as text and numbers in a specific structured format.
- Each line of the file corresponds to one row in the table.
- Within each line, fields(columns) are separated by tab.
- For example, the .txt for the table below looks like:

<br>

 <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Column-1</th>
    <th>Column-2</th>
    <th>Column-3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>input1</td>
    <td>input2</td>
    <td>input3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>input4</td>
    <td>input5</td>
    <td>input6</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>input7</td>
    <td>input8</td>
    <td>input9</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

<pre><span style="color:crimson;">
Column-1  Column-2  Column-3
input1  input2 input3
input4  input5 input6
input7  input8 input9
</span></pre>

<br>

</details>

- However, the GSEA software does not recognize the .txt file as a preranked gene list. We instead need to make the file a ranked file (.rnk)
- We have already formatted the table to conform to the requirements of a .rnk file, we just now need to simply change the file extension from .txt to .rnk.
- There are multiple ways to do this. One of the ways is to use the 'rename' option when right clicking on the file. However, in some cases (especially on Mac), users do not have the file extension visible (I believe this is by default), and so renaming the file `preranked-DEGs-GSEA.rnk` will actually make it `preranked-DEGs-GSEA.rnk.txt`.
- Instead, we will use the terminal window in VSCode to use the `cp` command.
- Open VSCode again, and click on `File` then select `Open Folder`. Then select the folder where you saved the files.
- Now click `Terminal` and select `New Terminal` to open a new terminal window at the bottom of your screen. The terminal should be in the correct directory. Check using the `pwd` command. If you are not in the correct directory, use the `cd` command to get there.
- Now we can use the `cp` command to copy the `preranked-DEGs-GSEA.txt` file to the same location but under a different extension:

```
# check to see if you're in the correct location
pwd

# check to see if the file is there
